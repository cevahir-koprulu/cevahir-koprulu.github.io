              <h1>Research</h1>
              <p>
              I do research on reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on generalization and curriculum learning (CL). 
              My publications can be found on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3vnXbccAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1">my Google Scholar page</a>, and some are listed with details below. 
              During my Ph.D. so far, I have done research internships at Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence and Honda Research Institute. 
              At Bosch, I developed <strong>CL4AD</strong>, the first integration of CL into batched autonomous driving simulators, accelerating training by 77%.
              At HRI, I developed an action advising framework, Gen2Spec, that distills knowledge from generalist agents to specialists in a continual learning setting. 
              Recently, I have been focusing on the following research directions:
              <ul>
                <li><span><strong>Risk-aware CL for RL-based Post Training:</strong> We develop a risk-aware curriculum generation algorithm for RL-based fine-tuning of language models.</li>
                <li><span><strong>Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty-aware CL:</strong> We adopt conformal prediction for curriculum learning to prioritize tasks with high model uncertainty during post-training.</li>
                <li><span><strong>Synthetic Curricula for Autonomous Driving:</strong> We guide generative models via curriculum learning for synthetic traffic scenario generation.</li>
                </ul>
              
              <h2>Curriculum Learning for Reinforcement Learning</h2> 
              The design of task sequences, i.e., curricula, improves the performance of RL agents and speeds up the convergence in complex tasks.
              An effective curriculum typically begins with easy tasks and gradually changes them toward the target tasks.
              Common approaches require manually tailoring the curricula to identify easy and hard tasks, which requires domain knowledge that might be unavailable.
              My research focuses on developing automated curriculum generations algorithms that utilize generative models, introduce notions of risk and uncertainty, address constrained RL, and exploit task specifications.

              <h2>Exploiting Side Information for Offline and Mixed RL</h2> 
              We investigate use of side information to improve the performance of RL agents offline and mixed (offline + online) settings.
              For offline RL, we develop an uncertainty-aware, offline model-based reinforcement learning approach (NUNO) with neural stochastic differential equations, 
              levelaraging prior physics knowledge as inductive bias, improving state-of-the-art in low-quality data regimes. 
              For mixed settings, we introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in (1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 
              (2) a few task-specific expert demonstrations for dense dynamics-aware reward synthesis.

              <h2>Learning Reward Machines and Policies</h2> 
              We study the problem of reinforcement learning for a task encoded by a reward machine. 
              The task is defined over a set of properties in the environment, called atomic propositions, and represented by Boolean variables. 
              One unrealistic assumption commonly used in the literature is that the truth values of these propositions are accurately known. 
              In real situations, however, these truth values are uncertain since they come from sensors that suffer from imperfections. 
              At the same time, reward machines can be difficult to model explicitly, especially when they encode complicated tasks. 
              We develop a reinforcement-learning algorithm that infers a reward machine that encodes the underlying task while learning how to execute it, despite the uncertainties of the propositions' truth values.              <p></p>

              <h2>Level-k Game Theory to Model Human Drivers</h2>
              Level-k game theory is a hierarchical multi-agent decision-making model where a level-k player is a best responder to a level-(k-1) player.
              In this work, we studied level-k game theory to model reasoning levels of human drivers. 
              Different from existing methods, we proposed a dynamic approach, 
              where the actions are the levels themselves, resulting in a dynamic behavior. 
              The agent adapts to its environment by exploiting different behavior models as available moves to choose from, depending on the requirements of the traffic situation.
